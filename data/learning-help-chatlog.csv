My goal is to have a progress bar for  a time-consuming method that returns a value. I am using the ProgressBarMorph. To control it from within the iterations I have to run them in a forked process. But then the method tries to return the value before it is computed inside these iterations. So I use a semaphore to make the main process wait for the iterations to end before returning the value. But this freezes the main process and has the same effect as not forking anything at all., , Here is a simple script that models my problem. It should open a progress bar, update its values during 5 seconds, then close in, open the Transcript, and show the message 'Done!'. But the main process can't show the progress bar until the semaphore receives a signal (until it's time to close it). So there is just a 5-second delay, and then the Transcript opens., ```, delay := Delay forSeconds: 1., n := 5., progressStep := 100 / n., , semaphore := Semaphore new., , progressBar := ProgressBarMorph new., progressBar openInWindow., progressBar window width: 500., , [ ""Starting the fork"",     n timesRepeat: [,         delay wait.,         progressBar value: (progressBar value + progressStep) ]., ,     progressBar window close.,     semaphore signal, ] fork., , semaphore wait., Transcript open; clear., Transcript show: 'Done!'; cr., ```, Is it possible to open a progress bar in a second forked process, freeze the main process, and keep the two forked ones running with the first one (with iterations) updating the progress bar in the second one?, , Or maybe there is a better solution?",
98116,0,2,,,,d,,25-Apr-17 17:08,jecisc#7963,Hum. I think that progress bar should not be managed directly in Pharo but via Jobs. (At least I always so it used that way),

122136,0,1,,,,,,01-May-17 09:22,oleks#8268,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/305208145020715019/308578838298755073/received_1896643550604300.png
122136,0,2,CPU,,,,,03-May-17 07:15,kilon#3275,you can use multiple cores by firing multiple pharo instances. When a new process is create the OS assigns it to its own CPU core to take full advantage of CPU's processing power. Which is great for pharo because you have nothing to do to make it work.,
122136,0,2,"Sockets,Shared memory",,,,,03-May-17 07:15,kilon#3275,you can communicate between those pharo instances via sockets or shared memory,
122136,0,2,Sockets,,,,,03-May-17 07:16,kilon#3275,sockets is more flexible because allows communication over network,
122136,0,2,shared memory,,,,,03-May-17 07:17,kilon#3275,"shared memory is a ton faster but you can do it only locally but also has the advantage of storing the memory inside a file without an explicit save actions , it is handled by the OS,  so even in the case of an image crash you still do not lose your data",
122136,0,2,"c, Multiple core",,,,,03-May-17 07:19,kilon#3275,"C supports running on mutliple cores because its a performance orientated language, pharo is not, pharo is a RAD (Rapid application development) enviroment so it focus more on keeping things easy",
122136,0,2,multiple cores,,,,,03-May-17 07:20,kilon#3275,running on multiple cores is called parrarell programming and can be very hard because of unpredictable behaviours,
122136,0,2,multiple thread,,,,,03-May-17 07:21,kilon#3275,eg. creating multiple thread that running on each core each can be actually slower than having a single thread. This means that you need to be aware of the architecture of the system which is a low level area of coding hence highly technical and everything you do should be profiled meaning zero assumptions / everything tested on how much time exactly it takes.,
122136,0,2,parallel coding,,,,,03-May-17 07:23,kilon#3275,even with the technique I described for pharo I would not advise using it unless you need to. Parrel coding is no magic pill that will make your code faster.,
122136,0,2,"gpu,cpu",,,,,03-May-17 07:26,kilon#3275,"Further if you code needs a heavy amount of parrarelisation , say you need to perform the same action on tons of data at the same time , then GPU is far more capable. GPU offers less flexibility that CPU parrelisation but it also offer a huge boost to performance. A GPU can be up to 100 times faster than CPU. For example my very weak GPU (Nvidia GT 755M ) is about 3 times faster than my 3.4 GHz quad core CPU",
122136,0,2,,,,,,03-May-17 07:26,kilon#3275,so @oleks#8268 as you can see its not a simple process no matter what language you use,
122136,0,2,cPPBridge,,,,,03-May-17 07:30,kilon#3275,if you are interested in the shared memory solution you can take a look at my CPPBridge library (I use it to communicate and use C++ libraries from pharo),
122136,0,2,,,,,,03-May-17 07:31,kilon#3275,if you are interested in the socket solution you can take a look at my Atlas library (I use it to communicate and use python libraries from pharo),

122136,2,32,,,,,,05-May-17 17:20,kilon#3275,"the only way python does it is with multiprocessing, its like I said with Pharo, it starts multiple pythons and use its thread api which calls ""threading"" to communicate between the provesses",

122136,2,32,"OS,parrallel threads ",,,,,05-May-17 17:24,kilon#3275,"concurency is similar to above but fakes it , it does not execute more than one thing at the time but makes it appear as it executes multiple things, it basically executes each thing one tiny piece at a time , so this way you do not have to finish one thing to go to the next. However that means because only one things executes at a time there is no reason for the OS to provide more than one core.",
122136,2,32,,,,,,05-May-17 17:26,kilon#3275,"real thread on a dynamic language are much more difficult because o dynamic data, in C things are a lot more static and a lot more predictable . The irony is that the VM does indeed use multiple threads but only its main thread is provided for the execution of pharo code.",
122136,2,32,,,,,,05-May-17 17:27,kilon#3275,"as i said, pararrel coding is a pain in the ass , not that hard to learn but a pain to maintain",
122136,2,32,UFFI,,,,,05-May-17 17:30,kilon#3275,if i remember correctly however you can have a dll that executes in multiple thread and use it via UFFI ... BUT.... that DLL will have to join its threads to one or at least one thread is the one that communicates with pharo and not multiple threads. Which basically means parrarel execution for the DLL but only concurent communication (UFFI) with Pharo.,
122136,2,32,,,,,,05-May-17 17:32,kilon#3275,In the link you provided Eliot confirms what I am saying,
122136,2,32,Multi threading,t,,cite,,05-May-17 17:32,kilon#3275,"```, Multi-threading, , While multi-threading seems like an obvious and important direction to take the system in, making the VM multi-threaded per-se does not provide any benefit before the Smalltalk image is made thread-safe and that is probably more work than providing a multi-threaded VM.  Hence a potentially more profitable approach is to concentrate on federating multiple VMs running multiple images, communicating through the threaded FFI., ```",
122136,2,32,c libraries,,,,,05-May-17 17:36,kilon#3275,"so yes you can have c libraries running on multiple cores , I think there is a build of Cog that allows that but again the calls of UFFI themselves cannot be pararrel so for example you cannot call multiple things at the same time. If I remember correctly last time I checked, callbacks were not supported for that build",
122136,2,32,,,,,,05-May-17 17:38,kilon#3275,"this is the approach python third party libraries that focus on parrarel coding use. Technically speaking thas all nice and dandy but because you will have to join threads, if I am not mistaken, that will take away from your performance",
122136,2,32,"costly, slower",,,,,05-May-17 17:40,kilon#3275,"Also please note that its not a good idea to have more thread than twice  your cores, each core supports hyper threading which provides 2 threads instead of one, if you get more than twice your code will start slowing down because you wont be able take more advantage of the core cause you try to exceed 100% but also communication of threads is quite costly",
122136,2,32,,,,,,05-May-17 17:40,kilon#3275,sorry for the long write but as I said its a very complex subject,
122136,2,32,native c threads,t,,om,,05-May-17 23:05,BenComan#8536,"@kilon#3275 Read my comment more closely.  ""Multi-threading"" was not what I referenced.  It was this... ""The Cog VM is single-threaded, providing **green threads** to the Smalltalk level, as do most Smalltalk VMs. [...] A subclass of the CoInterpreter, CoInterpreterMT  ... provides a Python-like multi-threaded VM where any number of [native] threads can share the VM with only one running the VM at any one time.""    As you noted this is like the Python GIL - but its not mainstream yet, just a prototype.  But @oleks#8268  queried to ""implement your algorithm in C"" to use native threads.  Actually you can somewhat use native-threads to do this already - but the VM blocks where the Image does the FFI callout to the C function which distributes the heavy computation to multiple-CPUs, and must wait for all those threads to complete before returning the single-threaded result to where the VM is waiting.  What the CoInterpreterMT provides is for native threads to callback into the VM, and for multiple spawned native-threads to proceed in parallel with the single-VM-thread.",

Something like: ```imageC := imageA overlay: imageB``` or ```^ imageA overlay: imageB``` Right now I am able to bring images into Pharo as imageMorphs ```ImageMorph withForm: (ImageReadWriter formFromFileNamed: 'imageFiles/pictureA.png')).```, , I read through the Morphic chapter in PBE, but am new to Morphic and still don’t quite understand how to solve this problem. Should I even be looking at Morphic? I just need to display the images. I don’t need to have them react to anything. , , Thanks in advance.<3",

What you actually request/say: please do the work for me. ;), Remember that this is an open source community and most of us spend our spare time on Pharo without being paid. We make good progress - but each one of us only works on stuff he needs and he can contribute back. So either you work on it yourself and contribute back, find someone with knowledge who has the same need or you hire someone to do it for you. Simple as that and Pharo is not different from other communities here., , The only thing we can currently do at the moment is to give you a helping hand in questions",

652658,0,2,,,,,,24-Jul-17 16:22,astares#3016,"@psvensson#2156 , , So you are looking for ""constructure"" like messages (sent to a class) to instantiate and directly initialize some state in your objects?, , For this you usually create specific class side methods in a method tag/protocol called ""instance creation""., , So for instance if you have a class Person with an instance variable name. And on the instance side you have a getter #name and a setter #name: , , You can have a class side method:, ```Smalltalk,    named: aString,          ^(self new),                 name: aString;,                 yourself, ```, The parentheses are not required but are usually used for better readability because new is a class side method followed by message sends to the instance like #name:, Also #yourself (who returns just self ) is to ensure the instance is returned even when previous messages might have other return values., , Now you  easily write:, ```Smalltalk,    p := Person named: 'Kay', ```, Or think of a class side message #firstName:name: implemented like this, ```Smalltalk, firstName: aFirstName name: aLastName,       ^(self named: aLastName),               firstName: aFirstName;,               yourself, ````, where the initial #named: method is used as a class side method can other class side methods too. , , , ```Smalltalk,    p := Person firstName: 'Alan' name: 'Kay', ```, , Hope this is what you are looking for. , , You can even overwrite #new to disallow object creation without initialization:, , ```Smalltalk,   new,         self error: 'Use #named: to instantiate.' , ```, , BTW:, If I remember correctly Roassal has a QuadTree implementation (or at least there was a discussion about integrating one)",
652658,0,2,,,,,,24-Jul-17 16:27,astares#3016,"Also note that in Pharo any instantiation via #new sends #initialize to the new object., Thats why on the instance side you can override #initialize to provide some default values if always required., (You should not forget to call super initialize in your custom #initialize method to respect inheritance initializiation):, , ```Smalltalk,  initialize,      ""Initializes the receiver"",      super initialize.,      self ,          firstName: '';,          name: '', ```",
652658,0,5,,,,,,24-Jul-17 16:36,psvensson#2156,"Wow! Yes, this _is_ what I'm looking for. I know I've read something like this somewhere, because I recognize the overriding new thing, but I think I knew to little Smalltalk back then.  Theis is very much what I need right now, thanks!",
652658,0,32,,,,,,24-Jul-17 16:36,astares#3016,"Also note there is another instantiation message called #basicNew that you can use to , circumvent double initialization when you implement custom instance creation methods:, , When you have on the instance side an initial method like this:, , ```Smalltalk,    initialize,            super initialize.,            self ,                firstName: '';,                lastName: '';, ```,  it is better to implement class side methods like this: , , ```Smalltalk,    firstName: firstName lastName: lastName,            ^(self basicNew),                      firstName: firstName;,                      lastName: lastName;,                      yourself, ```, and then,  ```Smalltalk,    firstName: firstName ,            ^self firstName: firstName lastName: '', ```, and ,  ```Smalltalk,    lastName: lastName ,            ^self firstName: '' lastName: lastName, ```, So when you implement the class side creation message with the most parameters you can writer smaller ones calling it.",

652658,0,32,,,,,,24-Jul-17 17:10,astares#3016,"There are many other examples. Sometimes this is also used for conversion methods , , ```Smalltalk,  (5 to: 10) asArray    , ```, , Many things are not abvious in the first place - but remember that Smalltalk is mostly implemented in itself. And the browser, inspector, source code, ... is right in front of you to check it all out., , I often hear some developers coming from other languages lamenting that Smalltalk has a silly syntax, some concepts are too different, there is no 'case' statement or other. , , These people even when they do some tinkering with Smalltalk will never really understand it. They also usually put Smalltalk aside after they played a little bit. Because they fail as they try to learn it the same way as they learned C, Java, Go, ..., , But for a developer to learn Smalltalk one usually has to **unlearn** any other thing you have learned in other languages and start completely new. , Just thinking in terms of **objects** and **messages** which is not as easy as it often sounds - because procedural thinking is often too close., , Also to learn it one should stop comparing with traditional languages. Often beginners have a better learning curve than people from traditional languages., , Dig your way to the system and check how you can browse messages, check the senders, the implementors. Look how methods are implemented (especially on Kernel classes) and Smalltalk will open its beauty and pure OO power.",

So it is not like code - it is more like data. , , So you maintain Smalltalk images like a database over time (they are an example of the longest maintained software, Pharo image goes back to 1980 Apple Smalltalk if not even 1972)., , And you can shoot yourself in the foot by throwing away the wrong objects or do other fancy stuff like swapping the wrong object pointers. , , Try , ```Smalltalk, true become: false, ```, in an image you do not need or , ```Smalltalk, Color black become: Color white, ```, to get some nice color effects on the UI 😃",
